      <h2>Why I Want to Visit Antarctica</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; font-family: Tahoma; text-indent: 36px;">
        Antarctica is the coldest and windiest continent on Earth, and it is one of the few places that still feels
        truly untouched by modern life. I want to experience its silence, endless ice fields, and dramatic skies that
        change from soft blue to bright white in just a few moments. The place is also home to penguins, seals, and
        whales, which makes it feel like a living documentary in real time. More than tourism, visiting Antarctica
        would be a chance to understand climate change in a place where its effects are already visible.
      </p>
      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px; font-family: Tahoma; text-indent: 36px;">
        Antarctica has no permanent cities and no native human population. Most people there are scientists and support
        teams working at research stations. During summer, daylight can last almost the entire day, while in winter,
        darkness dominates for long periods. The continent stores most of the planet's freshwater in its ice sheets.
        That is one reason why Antarctica is one of the most important places for global scientific research.
